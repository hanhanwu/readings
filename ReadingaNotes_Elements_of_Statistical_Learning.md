So, finally I can spend more time to study this book, I have heard that it's a great statistics book for machine learning. Here, I am recodring the notes when I am reading. I am also marking on the book and will post the marked book after finish the whole book :)

NOTE: It's better to read Data Mining bible and this book together, and read the bible first since it contains more specific examples: http://www.kvimis.co.in/sites/kvimis.co.in/files/ebook_attachments/Jiawei%20Han,%20Micheline%20Kamber,%20ian%20Pei%20Data%20Mining%203%20ed.pdf

CHAPTER 14 - UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

* Association Rules
* Apriori Alg
  * Requires only one pass over the data for each value of |K|, since it assumes the data cannot be fitted into a computerâ€™s main memory. Therefore, it allows this analysis to be applied to huge data bases
  * The goal of this analysis is to produce association rules (14.7) with both high values of support and confidence. However, rules with high confidence or lift, but low support, will not be discovered, because the number of solution item sets, their size, and the number of passes required over the data can grow exponentially with decreasing size of this lower bound
