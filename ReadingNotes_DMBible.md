The bible is the bible, deserve to read and think again and again! This is the reading notes for my favorite data mining book, written by the father of Data Mining. The book includes not only detailed description & easy-to-understand examples for machine learning algorithms, machine learning methods, but also contains great summary of data warehousing, as well as general summary of data preprocessing methods.
