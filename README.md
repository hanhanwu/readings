BANKING KNOWLEDGE

* Credit Bureaus  â€” a company that collects information from various sources and provides consumer credit information on individual consumers for a variety of uses.
* BNI Score - Bankruptcy Navigator Index (BNI). a number that indicates the likelihood of an individual filing for bankruptcy. It is related to the better-known credit score, but unlike credit scores, bankruptcy risk scores are not sold to consumers by any of the credit bureaus.[1] Consequentially, individuals have little or no way of knowing what their bankruptcy risk scores are or how to improve upon them. Furthermore, since there is no standardized index of measurement, consumers often have trouble contextualizing their score on a standardized scale, instead only receiving general information from a single bureau http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/bankruptcy-risk-score-1270.php
* Beacon score is a number generated by the Equifax Credit Bureau to rank an individual's credit-worthiness. Beacon scores are credit scores, which are determined through a complex algorithm. These numbers tell the lender how likely it is that the borrower will repay the loanBeacon score is a number generated by the Equifax Credit Bureau to rank an individual's credit-worthiness. Beacon scores are credit scores, which are determined through a complex algorithm. These numbers tell the lender how likely it is that the borrower will repay the loan. When NextGen FICO scores started being used, the Beacon score was replaced with the Pinnacle score.

* TDS - Total Debt Service Ratio,  http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totaldebtserviceratio.asp
* Social capital is a form of economic and cultural capital in which social networks are central, transactions are marked by reciprocity, trust, and cooperation, and market agents produce goods and services not mainly for themselves, but for a common good.
The term generally refers to (a) resources, and the value of these resources, both tangible (public spaces, private property) and intangible ("actors", "human capital", people), (b) the relationships among these resources, and (c) the impact that these relationships have on the resources involved in each relationship, and on larger groups. It is generally seen as a form of capital that produces public goods for a common good.
Social capital has been used to explain the improved performance of diverse groups, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, superior managerial performance, enhanced supply chain relations, the value derived from strategic alliances, and the evolution of communities.

* Discretionary income: is the amount of an individual's income that is left for spending, investing or saving after taxes and personal necessities (such as food, shelter, and clothing) have been paid. Discretionary income includes money spent on luxury items, vacations and non-essential goods and services.
* Detached Housing: A single-family detached home, also called a single-detached dwelling, single-family residence (SFR) or separate house is a free-standing residential building. It is defined in opposition to a multi-family residential dwelling.

Art and Art Stories!

* Living Life Sculpture
 * Recently I just wantched a speech given by an 80 years old artist and it is quite inspiring. The artist is called Wang Deshun.
 * He has been famous in world wide pantomime troupe for decades, but he became famous recently in China after he appeared on a fashion show at age 80....: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC0m65hOEow
 * During the speech, he was talking about his pantomime troupe, the most famous one should be Living Life Sculpture and this is a unique art form: http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjkyOTc3NDMy.html
 * Based no what he described, in this Living Life Sculpture, they have used 3 female schulpture, and he was acting as a male sculpture to build the stories. The 3 love stories are Adam and Eve (love in paradise), Rodin and Camille Claudel (love on the earth), XXX (I forgot the name...) and France (love in hell). These 3 love stories all share 1 thing in common, they are love tragedies. Based on what he described, love is suffering and it can happen in paradise, on the earth and in the hell.
 * Although I don't quite understand why the love story between Adam and Eve is a tragedy and tonight I no longer have patience to finish watching the third one, but I like the second one.
 * I have even checked Camille Claudel's wiki:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Claudel
 * It is a tragedy, I feel terribly sorry for this type of genious woman, be jealoused because of her unusual talents, finally veen the man she loved cinsidered her as his rival (this is so sad). I never understand why men are always so narrow hearted, love can never stop a man from envying his woman but for most of the women, they can be both talented and deeply love the man.... Sometimes, I think, maybe women are born to be better than men, but for some historical reason, people are not willing to admit this...
