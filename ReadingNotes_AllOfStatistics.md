As Professor Mori recommended, besides Elements of Statistis, another book is also great, called "All of Statistics". Now I am reading it when my code is running. Need to take notes for those sattistics details I didn't know. Although I downloaded the free book from school library, it's better to put the book url from Amazon. You can find the book here: https://www.amazon.com/All-Statistics-Statistical-Inference-Springer/dp/1441923225
