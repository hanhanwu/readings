As Professor Mori recommended, besides Elements of Statistis, another book is also great, called "All of Statistics". Now I am reading it when my code is running. Need to take notes for those sattistics details I didn't know. Although I downloaded the free book from school library, it's better to put the book url from Amazon. You can find the book here: https://www.amazon.com/All-Statistics-Statistical-Inference-Springer/dp/1441923225

CHAPTER 11 - Hypothesis Testing and p-values

* H0 is null hypothese, H1 is alternative hypothesis. The goal is to reject H0 or not
* Type 1 error - reject H0 when H0 is true (like false positive)
* Type 2 error - reject H1 when H1 is true (like false negative)
* one-side test: To test `H0 >= x vs. H1 < x`, or `H0 < x vs. H1 >= x`
* two-side test: To test `H0 == x vs. H1 != x`
* 3 Major Tests
  * Wald Test
  * p-test
  * chi-square distribution
* When using Wald test, testing the hypothesis equivalents to checking whether the null value is in the confidence interval
* To make it more informative, by not only knowing reject H0 or not, but also knowing at which level reject H0, here comes p-tes. This level value is p-value, <b>the smaller the p-value, the stronger evidence against H0</b>
  * p-value < 0.01: very strong evidence against H0
  * 0.01 <= p-value <= 0.05: strong evidence against H0
  * 0.05 < p-value < 0.1: wake evidence against H0
  * p-value >= 0.1: little or no evidence against H0
  * p-value is NOT the probability that the null hypothesis H0 is true
  * If p-value is less than 0.05, then you can report that "the result is statistically significant at 5 percent level". And H0 (null hypothesis) will be rejected only and only if p-value < 0.05
  * NOTE: A result can be statistically significant but the size of effect can be small, which is not practically significantly. Therefore, you need to mention confidence interval too
