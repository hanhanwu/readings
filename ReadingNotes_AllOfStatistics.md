As Professor Mori recommended, besides Elements of Statistis, another book is also great, called "All of Statistics". Now I am reading it when my code is running. Need to take notes for those sattistics details I didn't know. Although I downloaded the free book from school library, it's better to put the book url from Amazon. You can find the book here: https://www.amazon.com/All-Statistics-Statistical-Inference-Springer/dp/1441923225

CHAPTER 11 - Hypothesis Testing and p-values

* H0 is null hypothese, H1 is alternative hypothesis. The goal is to reject H0 or not
* Type 1 error - reject H0 when H0 is true (like false positive)
* Type 2 error - reject H1 when H1 is true (like false negative)
* one-side test: To test `H0 >= x vs. H1 < x`, or `H0 < x vs. H1 >= x`
* two-side test: To test `H0 == x vs. H1 != x`
