# Learning Trading Systems ðŸŒº

I'm learning this book [Trading Systems and Methods][1], and already started to feel excited about the new knowledge. Taking some learning notes here for my future use! ðŸ’–

## Terminology
* These are the terminology not mentioned in other sections here.
### The law of averages
* It means, the number of average items is extremely large that small abnormal events do not affect the balance.
* A long term of profits, losses or an abnormal event will be offset over time by the overwelmingly number of normal events.
* `weighted average = (a1d1 + a2d2 + ... andn)/(d1 + d2 + ... + dn)`
  * `ai` is the average price during the time interval; `di` is the total days during the time interval
  * having the number of days as the weight here helps tell the average price in a more accurate way
* `geometric mean = G = (a1 * a2 * .... * an)^(1/n)`, or `(ln(G) = (ln(a1) + ln(a2) + ... + ln(an))/n)`
  * `a1 .. an-1` are the smallest price of each interval, `an` is the largest price of the last interval; `n` is the number of time intervals
  * natural log here
  * This mean helps measure the price growth, it's important when using data represent precentages, ratios or rates of changes.
* `quadratic mean = sqrt(sum(power(ai))/N)`
  * It often used to estimate errors
* `harmonic mean = H = n/sum(1/ai)`
  * Similar to geometric mean, `a1 .. an-1` are the smallest price of each interval, `an` is the largest price of the last interval; `n` is the number of time intervals
* `arithmetic mean > geometric mean > harmonic mean` when the distribution is not perfectly symmetric
  * "arithmetic mean" here is the weighted average with equal weight
  
### Distribution
* 4 moments of distribution
  * mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis
    * Kurtosis measures the peakness of the distribution. For a more flatten distribution, it's negative kurtosis; for a more peaked distribution, it's positive kertosis.
      * <b>The kurtosis of the daily returns will be better than 3 if the system is profitable.</b>
        * The normal value of kurtosis is 3

## Suggestions
* None of these are the only factor for decison making.

### About Noise
* Checking the noise helps decide which market to trade and whether to enter a market quickly or wait a bit.
  * <b>A trend system can be more profitable when the price series has less noise, and a mean reversion strategy is better when there is more noise.</b>
  * To measure the noise, we can often use `efficiency ratio`
    * `efficiency_ratio = abs(Pt - Pt-n) / sum(abs(Pi - Pi-1)), i = t-n ... t`
      * "P" means price here, "Pi" means the price at time i
      
### About Data Collection
* More data more situations
  * large amount of data can be more reliable
  * Better to include both bull and bear markets, occasional large price shork, etc.
  * Older data doens't mean irrelevant
* Better to focus on data from US or Europe, other data sources can be late or less accurate
* Having both training and testing data

### Metrics
#### Error Measurement
* `sample error = 1/sqrt(N)`, N is the data size.
  * It helps tell how much data do you need to achieve enough accuracy
  * To achieve around 5% error, it needs 400 trades
* `standard error = SE = sqrt(var/n)`, n is sample size
  * It uses multiple data samples to estimate the data distribution. The value determines how the sample means differ from the actual mean. -- The uniformity of data
  * People also use all the data with size N, instead of multiple samples
