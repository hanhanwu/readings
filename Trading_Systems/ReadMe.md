# Learning Trading Systems ðŸŒº

I'm learning this book [Trading Systems and Methods][1], and already started to feel excited about the new knowledge. Taking some learning notes here for my future use! ðŸ’–

## [Terminology & Usage][7]
* Having all the terminology in 1 chapter of an e-book is such a torture, but have to take notes so that later it's easier to check again.


## Suggestions
* None of these are the only factor for decison making.

### About Noise
* Checking the noise helps decide which market to trade and whether to enter a market quickly or wait a bit.
  * <b>A trend system can be more profitable when the price series has less noise, and a mean reversion strategy is better when there is more noise.</b>
  * To measure the noise, we can often use `efficiency ratio`
    * `efficiency_ratio = abs(Pt - Pt-n) / sum(abs(Pi - Pi-1)), i = t-n ... t`
      * "P" means price here, "Pi" means the price at time i
      
### About Data Collection
* More data more situations
  * large amount of data can be more reliable
  * Better to include both bull and bear markets, occasional large price shork, etc.
  * Older data doens't mean irrelevant
* Better to focus on data from US or Europe, other data sources can be late or less accurate
* Having both training and testing data

### Interest Rates Movememt Direction vs Indicators
* I guess those missing conditions here means uncertain?
#### Indicator - Interest Rates
* `R = 1 - Rate of Inflation/Yield`
  * R is ratio
  * Yield is the 3 month treasury bill
  * `R_avg` is 20-day average of R
* `Inflation Yield Oscillator(IYO) = R - R_avg`
* If `(R < 0.2 or IYO < 0) and Yield_t > Yield_t-3mo`, then rates increase
* If `(R > 0.3 or IYO > 0.5) and Yield_t < Yield_t-3mo`, then rates will fall
#### Indicator - Money Supply
* If `(M2_m - M2_m-1) > (M2_m - M2_m-6) and Yield_t > Yield__t-11mo`, then rates will rise
  * `M2_m` is monthly money supply
* If `(M2_m - M2_m-1) < (M2_m - M2_m-6) and Yield_t < Yield__t-11mo`, then rates will fall
#### Indicator - Consumer Sentiment (CS)
* If `(CS_m > CS_m-12) and (CS_m > CS_m-11) and (Yield_t > Yield_t-4mo)`, then rates will rise
* If `(CS_m < CS_m-12) and (CS_m < CS_m-11) and (Yield_t < Yield_t-4mo)`, then rates will fall
#### Unemployment Claims (UC)
* If `UC_m < UC_m-11 and UC_m > UC_m-14`, then rates will rise
* If `UC_m > UC_m-11 and UC_m < UC_m-14`, then rates will fall

### Metrics
#### Error Measurement
* `sample error = 1/sqrt(N)`, N is the data size.
  * It helps tell how much data do you need to achieve enough accuracy
  * To achieve around 5% error, it needs 400 trades
* `standard error = SE = sqrt(var/n)`, n is sample size
  * It uses multiple data samples to estimate the data distribution. The value determines how the sample means differ from the actual mean. -- The uniformity of data
  * People also use all the data with size N, instead of multiple samples
