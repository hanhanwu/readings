Outlier Detection becomes a big chanllenge when it comes to temporal data. This book is talking about outlier detection techniques we can try when it comes to temporary data.
One thing I don't like this book is, it listed many papers and briefly talked aboue what these papers about. But papers do not have code examples, while I am in an urgent to find coding solutions at this moment... Although I downloaded this book from school library, it charges people a lot in the market... So unfair
